# External libraries

Some sketches require 3rd party library dependencies. These are located in `/libraries/<name>` as Processing
convention. This repo includes copies of the `/library` folder for these 3rd party libraries to make the
"clone -> run" workflow simple (so nothing breaks). But this leaves out javadocs, examples, etc. To get them
back you'll need to manually install every library through the Processing Library Manager.

# Install

1. `git clone` repo
2. Install Processing 2.2.1 for sketches in 2.2.1, or Processing 3.3.6 for sketches in 3.3.6.
3. Go to **File->Preferences** and set the Sketchbook location accordingly.
